Welcome to SoDA Lab! As the Principle Investigator of the lab, I work mainly at the intersection of software engineering and formal methods. My research aims to find better ways to design software systems that are safe, secure, and reliable to use. I am especially interested in automated reasoning, specification languages, design methods, model-driven engineering, system safety, security, and cyber-physical systems (CPS).
